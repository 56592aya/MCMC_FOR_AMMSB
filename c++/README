OpenMP seems not to work together with MvaPIch2. It has single-threaded performance.
OpenMPI seems to work fine. Don't know whether it has an RDMA implementation?

To be determined:
 - does OpenMP work with RamCloud?
 - does OpenMPI work with RamCloud?
 - does OpenMP work with our to-be-determined RDMA D-KV-store?
 - does OpenMPI work with our to-be-determined RDMA D-KV-store?
